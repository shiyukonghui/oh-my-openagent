/**
 * Loads codesign prompt section text from co-located `sections/*.md` files.
 *
 * Each section lives as its own `.md` file so PR diffs and git blame read
 * cleanly. Files are read at module-load time and exposed as frozen string
 * constants. Trailing `\n` (from editors adding final newline) is stripped.
 *
 * Path resolution uses `import.meta.url` — this file must stay co-located
 * with the `sections/` directory it reads from.
 *
 * This loader follows the same pattern used by open-codesign's prompt
 * section loader, enabling direct file sync when upstream updates.
